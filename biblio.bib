  abstract        = {Generative models have recently experienced a surge in
                  popularity due to the development of more efficient training
                  algorithms and increasing computational power. Models such as
                  adversarial generative networks (GANs) have been successfully
                  used in various areas such as computer vision, medical
                  imaging, style transfer and natural language generation.
                  Adversarial nets were recently shown to yield results in the
                  image-to-text task, where given a set of images, one has to
                  provide their corresponding text description. In this paper,
                  we take a similar approach and propose a image-to-emoji
                  architecture, which is trained on data from social networks
                  and can be used to score a given picture using ideograms. We
                  show empirical results of our algorithm on data obtained from
                  the most influential Instagram accounts.},
